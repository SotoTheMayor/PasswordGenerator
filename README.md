# PasswordGenerator

## Description

I created this tool to assist in generating passwords that were unique and meet the criteria of the user's needs.  While going through the process of making this, I learned how to organize arrays of data based on user input, and grab random items from those arrays.


## Installation

No steps needed to install.  Simply click the generate button, input criteria, and a password will be created to meet the selection.

## Usage

This tool is used to generate random passwords of a length between 8 and 128 characters.  The user can choose whether they want lower case, upper case, numbers, and/or special characters.  Upon input and selection of the above criteria, a random password is generated that can then be selected and copied.

## Credits

Starter code that included the HTML, CSS, and a foundation of JS was provided by the UMN bootcamp program.
